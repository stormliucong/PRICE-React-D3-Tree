# AI-human collaboration cost analysis

This React program aims to develop an interactive tree-structure visualization for decision makings. The program supports the use of external libraries if available. 

## Node Types

There are five types of nodes in the tree:

1. **Start Node**: Unique in the graph. Root of the graph.
2. **Decision Nodes**: Attributes include *name, expected_cost*.
3. **Action Nodes**: Attributes include *name, probability, cost, expected_cost*.
4. **Outcome Nodes**: Attributes include *name, probability, cost, expected_cost*.
5. **Exit Nodes**: No specific attributes. It is a special type of action node.

## Graph Building Options

1. **Add Node**:
   - In general, the nodes follows "Decision-Action-Outcome" logic
   - But decision and outcome can be hidden.
   - Can not add node after exit node
   - Sometime, it depends on the children. e.g. if there is an outcome already exist for action, only outcome is allowed to be added.

4. **Delete Node**:
   - All nodes can be deleted except for the start node.
   - When a node is deleted, all its descendant nodes are also deleted.

5. **Edit Node**:
   - Every time a node is editted, a modal popup appears, allowing the user to fill in the details about that node.

This structure allows for a dynamic and interactive way to visualize and manipulate tree structures, making it useful for a variety of applications.
