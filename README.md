# Interactive Tree Structure Visualization

This React program aims to develop an interactive tree-structure visualization. The program supports the use of external libraries if available.

## Node Types

There are five types of nodes in the tree:

1. **Start Node**: Unique in the graph.
2. **Decision Nodes**: Attributes include [id, name].
3. **Action Nodes**: Attributes include [id, action_name, cost, probability].
4. **Outcome Nodes**: Attributes include [id, name, cost, probability].
5. **Exit Nodes**: No specific attributes.

## Graph Building Options

1. **Start Node and Decision Nodes**:
   - When a user clicks on the start node or a decision node, they can create one or more action nodes connected by branches.
   - A decision node can link to multiple action nodes.

2. **Action Nodes**:
   - When a user clicks on an action node, they can create one or more outcome nodes.
   - An action node can link to multiple outcome nodes.

3. **Outcome Nodes**:
   - When a user clicks on an outcome node, they can create either an exit node or a decision node.
   - An outcome node can link to only one decision node.

4. **Node Deletion**:
   - All nodes can be deleted except for the start node.
   - When a node is deleted, all its descendant nodes are also deleted.

5. **Node Creation**:
   - Every time a node is created, a modal popup appears, allowing the user to fill in the details about that node.

This structure allows for a dynamic and interactive way to visualize and manipulate tree structures, making it useful for a variety of applications.
