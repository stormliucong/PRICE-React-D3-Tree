# PRICE - Personalized Recursive Intelligent Cost Estimation for Rare Disease Diagnosis

This React program aims to develop an interactive visualization for personalized cost estimation in rare disease diagnosis. 


## Getting Started
- Install node and npm
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/stormliucong/PRICE-React-D3-Tree.git
```
- In the project directory, run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
- The app will be launched in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the App in your browser.

## Use the App
This App allows for a dynamic and interactive way to visualize and manipulate tree structures.

### Node Types and Attributes

There are five types of nodes in the tree:

1. **Start Node**: Root of the graph.
2. **Decision Nodes**: Attributes include *name, expected_cost*.
3. **Action Nodes**: Attributes include *name, probability, cost, expected_cost*.
4. **Outcome Nodes**: Attributes include *name, probability, cost, expected_cost*.
5. **Exit Nodes**: No specific attributes. It is a special type of action node.

### Graph Building Options

1. **Add Node**:
   - In general, the nodes follows "Decision-Action-Outcome" logic
   - But decision and outcome can be hidden.
   - Can not add node after exit node
   - Sometime, it depends on the children. e.g. if there is an outcome already exist for action, only outcome is allowed to be added.

2. **Delete Node**:
   - All nodes can be deleted except for the start node.
   - When a node is deleted, all its descendant nodes are also deleted.

3. **Edit Node**:
   - Every time a node is editted, a modal popup appears, allowing the user to fill in the details about that node.

### Update Expect Cost
Expected cost at each node will be updated by recursively calculate the expected cost at its descendants and sum them together.
